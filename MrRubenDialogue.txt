Mr Ruben - Greeting
[The man is staring off into the distance, seemingly unaware of his surroundings.]
[As you get closer, however, he eyes you from behind his sunglasses.]
What? (1)

1. Player
How are things going? 		 (2)
You sound pissed.			 (3)
What's gotten you so cranky? (4)
What's your problem, buddy?  (5)

Mr Ruben
2. Oh great, just great! With the exception of the five-fucking-thousand caps i lost, everything is just fine! (6)
3. [Laughs] Oh you can tell, can't you? Try losing five thousand caps, that'll get you pissed. 			       (6)
4. Cranky doesn't even begin to describe it. Try losing five thousand caps, that'll get you pissed. 		   (6)
5. My problem? I just lost a heap of money is what! Five-fucking-thousand caps! Gone, just like that!          (6)

6. Player
Damn. that's gotta suck. 													 (7)
Gambling troubles? seems to be the most common cause of money loss in Vegas. (8)
It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.						     (9)
So what? You're in Vegas. Losing money is almost a given around these parts. (8)

Mr Ruben
7. Yeah, big time. Goddamn useless mercenaries.
   I paid them five thousand caps before the mission, and was gonna pay the rest afterwards. half up front, half upon completion.
   But then the fucking idiots go and get themselves killed by fiends! 	(10)

8. It's not because of gambling that I lost the money. I found out that my hired mercenaries were all killed by a group of fiends.
   I paid them five thousand caps before the mission, and was gonna pay the rest afterwards. half up front, half upon completion.
   But then the fucking useless bunch go and get themselves killed! 	(10)
	
9. It's not "just" fucking money, it's money i lost hiring the worst mercenaries around.
   I paid them five thousand caps before the mission, and was gonna pay the rest afterwards. half up front, half upon completion.
   But then the fucking idiots go and get themselves killed by fiends! 	(10)
   
10. Player
What was their job?									  (11)
Seriously, Fiends? I could've killed them all myself. (14)
Great! Less competition for me! 					  (14)

Mr Ruben
11. Now why should i tell you that? (12)

12. Player
I could help you with your problem.  (13)
I'm a mercenary myself.              (14)
You're right, i don't care. Goodbye. (15)

Mr Ruben
13. You do look like you can handle yourself, and given my current situation i suppose i need to hire someone else.
    Tell you what, you do this job for me and i'll pay you the five thousand caps. (16)
	
14. Are you for hire? Given my current situation i suppose i need to find someone else.
    Tell you what, you do this job for me and i'll pay you the five thousand caps. (16)

15. Then stop wasting my time.
	END CONVERSATION
	
16. Player
Tell me about the job first. (17)
Nah, not interested.(15)
	
Mr Ruben
17. They were supposed to clear out some fiends squatting on a valuable piece of land.
	You'd think it sounds like a simple enough job, but apparently not even that can be expected.
	The place in question is Vault 74. I want you to clear it out.
	I don't care how you do it, just make sure there's nothing alive in there when you get out. (18)

18. Player
(If Vault 74 was cleared beforehand) Vault 74? I've been there already. Everyone inside is dead. (19)
(Else)
Why the interest in Vault 74? 							 (20)
I'm not gonna kill anyone, if that's what you're asking. (21)
Let's talk about the reward. 							 (22)
Sure, i'll do it.			 							 (23)
Nah, not interested.		 							 (15)

Mr Ruben
19. {TBD}

20. That's none of your business. (25)

21. What are you, a soft-hearted merc? They're fiends, for fuck's sake! They all deserve to die.
	Maybe if you can get to their leader you can convince them to leave the vault.
	I don't fucking care either way, just get the fucking job done.
	Now where were we? (18)
	
22. What about it? (29)

23. Great. Vault 74 is located southwest of the REPCONN Headquarters, just north of of the NCR Ranger Safehouse.
	Go there, clear everything out, then come back for your reward.
	END CONVERSATION

25. Player
[Speech 50+] Oh but it is very much my business. I'm risking my life for it. (26)
[Speech 50-] Then why am i killing all these people? 						 (27)
Alright, i won't pry into it.												 (28)

Mr Ruben
26. Vault 74 has a computer inside it, which might contains some, ah, information that i want.
	My sources say that the vault still generates power, which means that the facility is still active.
	Hopefully that means the goddamn fiends haven't destroyed everything inside, yet. There might be something salvageable.
	First step though, is to clear the current residents out of it. (18)

27. Hah! As if fiends were people! They're worse than animals.
	Like i said, it's none of your business. Don't ask any more stupid questions or i'll find a smarter mercenary. (18)
	
28. Good. Can we get back to business now? (18)

29. Player
[Barter 80+] I want what you'd pay the others. Ten-thousand caps. (30)
[Barter 80-] Why don't you double it? 							  (31)
Actually, nevermind. 											  (32)

Mr Ruben
30. Alright, but only after you've done the job. I'm not giving mercs advance pay anymore. (18)

31. Because, as you might've guessed, i've already lost half of the previous team's reward.
	So no, i'm not doubling it. Five thousand. Take it or leave it. (18)

32. Then let's move on. (18)
